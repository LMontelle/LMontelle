# Initiatives I'm Proud of 🌱 <br>

 • I've been an event speaker at HeadstarterAI, Barnard College, and Columbia University <br>
 • My small business was selected as one of 140 vendors for an NYC showcase <br>
 • I was a guest judge at my old high school's hackathon, AtomHacks 2024 <br>

## My Systems Programming Projects 💐 <br>
 • Wrote two command line utilities that print the files matching a given permission string, alongside a simple library to recurse the file system and print out the matching files in a sorted manner. Fork(), exec(), and pipe() are used within the C language. <br>
 •An executable Minishell that emulates bash and runs a basic shell program. The shell implements cd and exit as built-ins, signal handling, and fork()/exec() for all other commands. <br>
